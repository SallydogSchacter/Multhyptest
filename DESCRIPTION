Title: Hypothesis Testing on Constrained Regression Parameters
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Elijah Schacter
Maintainer: Elijah Schacter <elisch@stanford.edu>
Description: This package was designed to implement hypothesis and power tests relating to constrained
  regression problems as outlined in Frank Wolak’s paper, Testing Inequality Constraints in
  Linear Economic Models (1989). However, that is not to say that its use should be limited to
  solely constrained regression; the package does generalize to any hypothesis/power question
  as long as certain conditions (like normality) are met. There are two main hypotheses
  that this package is meant to inspect in the hyptest and complex hyptest functions. First is  
  equality vs inequality (EI). Given a test variable, x ∈ Rn, a constraint matrix G, and constraint
  vector h, the null hypothesis in the EI test asserts that Gx=h, while the alternative is that
  Gx≥h. The second hypothesis this pacakge inspects is inequality vs unrestricted (IU). In
  this test, the null asserts that Gx≥h and the alternative is that x is unconstrained or x
  ∈ Rn. Both the EI and IU hypothesis tests provide critical insight to determine whether it
  is reasonable to place different constraints on a test variable given its mean and covariance
  structure. In the context of regression, these tests help determine whether hypothesized
  constraints placed on Beta should be implemented or not. Like in any hypothesis test,
  the null should be rejected if the p-value generated by the hyptest function is less than
  the desired signifigance level of the test (tests are all one-sided in implementation so don’t
  manipulate the outputted p-value). The last component of this package is the mult power
  function, which calculates the associated power of the two tests highlighted above. Viewing
  this in the context of regression again, power is other metric of how reasonable it is to impose
  the hypothesized constraints on Beta. In simple terms, power helps describe how much an
  unconstrained term would differ from its constrained counterpart; high power indicates a
  large difference, while a small power indicates a small difference.
